### Overview ###
JTDE is an editor for [XStream](http://xstream.codehaus.org) files.

The idea behind this editor is to provide a simple way to **create and edit XStream files** holding the required test-data.

By using XStream to 'outsource' your data you achieve **separation of test-data and test-code**.

This test approach is targeted to data objects with several (>3?) fields and for complex data structures containing nested fields.

### Installation and documentation ###
